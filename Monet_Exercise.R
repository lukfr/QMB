# Excercise the Master class Quantitative methods
# Questions to answer:
# 1) What is the fair price of a signed Monet painting with 150cm height and 100cm width?
# 2) In principle, shall I go to Christie's or Sotheby'2 or any other auctioneer
# 3) What is the value of a Monet signature?

#load Excel file Monet paintings sales data
monet_data <- read_excel('./Data_Sources/Data_Monet.xlsx')
head(monet_data)

#filter out paintings not sold (PRICE = 0.0)
monet_data[monet_data$PRICE != 0,]
attach(monet_data)

#create additional parameters
size <- HEIGHT*WIDTH

#first look at data
plot(size, PRICE, xlab="SIZE", col="blue", ylab="Price ", pch=10)

#using a linear regression model to estimate the influence of size and signature on the selling price
regSize <- lm(PRICE ~ size + SIGNED)
summary(regSize)
#Results:
# 1cmÂ² additional size results in a $2500 higher selling price
# a signature results in a $2,403 million higher selling price
#both statistical highly significant as p-test < 0.01


# 1) What is the fair price of a signed Monet painting with 150cm height and 100cm width?
# Create a Data Frame containing the values needed for the prediction
