# Excercise the Master class Quantitative methods
# Questions to answer:
# 1) What is the fair price of a signed Monet painting with 150cm height and 100cm width?
# 2) In principle, shall I go to Christie's or Sotheby'2 or any other auctioneer
# 3) What is the value of a Monet signature?

#load Excel file Monet paintings sales data

#filter out paintings not sold (PRICE = 0.0)

#first look at data

#Results:
# 1 INCHÂ² additional size results in a $2500 higher selling price
# a signature results in a $2,403 million higher selling price
#both statistical highly significant as p-test < 0.01
